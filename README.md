Tutorial on Joint Interface
===========================

[![Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer)

This tutorial will guide you to the use of **Motor Interfaces** to control the
iCub movements in the **joint space** relying on the following modalities:

- [**Position Control**](http://www.yarp.it/classyarp_1_1dev_1_1IPositionControl.html)
- [**Velocity Control**](http://www.yarp.it/classyarp_1_1dev_1_1IVelocityControl.html)
- [**Position-Direct Control**](http://www.yarp.it/classyarp_1_1dev_1_1IPositionDirect.html)

# Tutorial
We will show you how to control the elbow joint of the iCub arm in three different
contexts:

1. With a **single call** delivering the **final position set-point** to the low level layer.
1. With a **controller thread** that continuously computes the **velocity commands** to reach for a target.
1. With a **planner thread** streaming suitable **position references** used by the low level layer.

In the end, we will obtain the joint moving as below.

## How to operate the tutorial

Launch the applications available in [**`./app/scripts`**](./app/scripts) using [**yarpmanager**](http://www.yarp.it/yarpmanager.html): first the "_system_" part and then the "_app_" part.

The three modules open up the following three RPC ports:
- `/position`
- `/velocity`
- `/positiondirect`

Each RPC provides the following services:
- `go` to initiate the movement.
- `enc` to read the encoder feedback.

Use case:
```sh
$ yarp rpc /position
>> go
```

## Notes

You might want to play with our [**yarpmotorgui**](http://www.yarp.it/yarpmotorgui.html), which lets you interact with the joint control of the robot.

To do so, type:
```sh
$ yarpmotorgui --robot icubSim
```

# Diagrams of low-level control modalities

### :large_blue_circle: Position Control
The high-level user code provides a **one-shot command** in terms of **final position set-point** to achieve along with the **time required** to attain it (or, equivalently, the corresponding speed). Then, the low-level control is responsible for generating a suitable hard-coded trajectory (typically **minimum-jerk** profiles) connecting the current joint angle with the desired set-point as well as for controlling the motor to let the joint reach for the target. Thus, the **control takes place exclusively at the low-level**, whereas the high-level only sends the command to initiate the movement.

### :large_blue_circle: Velocity Control
The high-level user code is responsible for **continuosly providing joint velocity** to be used to solve a given task defined upstream (e.g. reach a position). The low-level layer is only dealing with the actual control of the motor, **instantly integrating the received velocity** into a position set-point. Therefore, part of the control **complexity is shifted to higher level**.

### :large_blue_circle: Position Direct Control
The high-level user code is responsible for **continuosly providing position references** to be used to solve a given task defined upstream. The low-level layer is only dealing with the actual control of the motor. This modality allows for doing **position planning** at higher level, since we may not need to read back the encoders to perform control upstream as in the case of velocity control. As a result, we can achieve **faster movements** (compared with closed-loop approach) with the freedom to **plan generic joint trajectories** (compared with profiles hard-coded in the firmware).
